# Special Relativity: A Geometric Viewpoint
web simulation regarding Special Relativity and Electromagnetism, with emphasis on the geometric relations

# To-do list:
1. Multi-language support
2. Fully integrated default, light and dark modes
3. Output rendered scenes to GIF or video file
4. Make the animations compatible with accessibility tools (i.e. relate the motion and visual outputs to sounds)
